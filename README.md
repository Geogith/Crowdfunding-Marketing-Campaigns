# Crowdfunding Successful Campaigns
Kickstarter Crowdfunding Service

Over $2 billion had been raised using the successful crowdsourcing service, Kickstarter, but not every campaign found success. To date, 300,000 campaigns have been launched on Kickstarter, with only a third having made it through the funding process with a positive outcome. Getting funded on Kickstarter required meeting or exceeding a project's initial goals, therefore many organizations spent months reviewing past projects in an attempt to discovering some tips for success. Using 4,000 past campaigns, I organized and analyzed the database in Microsoft Excel to see if I could uncover any insightful hidden trends. As a result of my detailed analysis the following insights were uncovered:

First, three conclusions could be drawn about Kickstarter campaigns?

1.)	Successful campaigns are seasonal. The best time of the year is late April - early May, according to the Pivot Chart Line Graph of months versus number of campaigns.
2.)	When I analyzed the data using a Stacked Column Pivot Chart based on category, theater campaigns had the most success. Music and Film & Video are the next successful campaigns, respectively.
3.)	When I analyzed the data using a Stacked Column Pivot Chart based on sub-category, plays have the most success within the theater category.

Secondly, what are some limitations of this dataset?

1.)	I don’t know why projects are more successful during late April – Early May and seasonally-driven.
2.)	I don’t know what makes a project successful other than funding.
3.)	I don’t know why certain countries favor specific campaigns.
