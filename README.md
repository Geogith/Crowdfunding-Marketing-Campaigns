# Crowdfunding Successful Campaigns
Kickstarter Crowdfunding Service

Over $2 billion was raised using the successful crowdsourcing service, Kickstarter, but not every campaign found success. To date, 300,000 campaigns have been launched on Kickstarter, with only a third having made it through the funding process with a positive outcome. Getting funded on Kickstarter required meeting or exceeding a project's initial goals, therefore many organizations spent months reviewing past projects in an attempt to discovering some tips for success. A funding analysis was performed using 4,000 past Crowdfunding Campaigns to determine what characterizes a successful campaign. The data set was organized and analyzed in Microsoft Excel. To describe the variability of the data set, three measures of central tendency (mean, median, and mode), summary statistics metrics, and Pivot Charts were to uncover any insightful hidden trends. The following insights were uncovered:

# RESULTS OF ANALYSIS

First, three conclusions could be drawn about Kickstarter campaigns?

1.)	Successful campaigns are seasonal. The best time of the year is late April - early May, according to the Pivot Chart Line Graph of months versus number of campaigns.
2.)	When I analyzed the data using a Stacked Column Pivot Chart based on category, theater campaigns had the most success. Music and Film & Video are the next successful campaigns, respectively.
3.)	When I analyzed the data using a Stacked Column Pivot Chart based on sub-category, plays have the most success within the theater category.

Secondly, what are some limitations of this dataset?

1.)	I don’t know why projects are more successful during late April – Early May and seasonally-driven.
2.)	I don’t know what makes a project successful other than funding.
3.)	I don’t know why certain countries favor specific campaigns.
